# L20-CodeForge

[![CI](https://github.com/yinli-systems/L20-CodeForge/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yinli-systems/L20-CodeForge/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Single-L20 post-training, verifier-guided inference, and executable benchmark
infrastructure for code models.

## Positioning

L20-CodeForge is kept as the executable-code benchmark and post-training sandbox
in the L20 project family. Its scope is benchmark protocol, candidate
generation, repair, verifier-guided inference, trajectory data, and reward
signals for code models.

For serving, kernel, and runtime infrastructure work, use
[l20-stack](https://github.com/yinli-systems/l20-stack). For from-scratch
pretraining and public checkpoint release artifacts, use
[l20-edu-135m-pretrain](https://github.com/yinli-systems/l20-edu-135m-pretrain).
This repository should stay focused on executable coding benchmarks rather than
becoming a second general L20 infrastructure repo.

L20-CodeForge is an eval-first research stack for making a small GPU budget
produce measurable coding capability. The project focuses on the pieces that
matter in real post-training work: clean benchmark protocol, public/private test
separation, candidate generation, repair, verifier experiments, trajectory data,
and negative-result audits.

Status: the repository currently demonstrates strong system-level gains on
public benchmarks. It does not yet claim a +15 point greedy model-weight
improvement over the base model.

[Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), and [paper draft](paper/README.md).

## Claim Boundary

- The LiveCodeBench and EvalPlus numbers above are system-level results unless a
  row explicitly says greedy model baseline.
- Public tests, public examples, and public prompt metadata may be used for
  candidate selection and repair. Hidden/private tests are reserved for final
  measurement and audits.
- This is not an official leaderboard submission. It is a reproducible local
  checkpoint with saved generations, reports, hashes, and protocol notes.
- Targeted probes, such as first-12 rescues or code-prefix experiments, are not
  presented as broad benchmark results.
- The current +15 goal is still open: the next milestone is to turn
  system-level gains into a cleaner greedy or single-sample model-capability
  improvement without overfitting to visible tests.

## What This Project Builds

L20-CodeForge is organized around one constraint: a single NVIDIA L20 should be
enough to run a serious coding post-training loop if the loop is selective,
measured, and executable.

![L20-CodeForge architecture](docs/assets/architecture.svg)

The repository contains:

- LiveCodeBench and EvalPlus evaluation harnesses with saved reports.
- Public-test selection, repair, and behavior-test tooling.
- Candidate health audits for syntax, entrypoint, and execution failure modes.
- A trajectory schema for repo-repair agents and model training data.
- SFT, DPO, reward-function, and GRPO/RLVR scaffolding.
- A migrated T4 GRPO reasoning experiment under
  [`experiments/grpo_t4/`](experiments/grpo_t4/), retained as an experiment
  artifact rather than a separate public repo.
- Single-L20 setup scripts and GPU sanity checks.

## Quickstart

Local development:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,bench]"
python -m pytest -q
python -m l20_codeforge verify-artifacts
python -m l20_codeforge profile
python -m l20_codeforge smoke-loop
```

The test command should finish with no failures. `verify-artifacts` should return
`"status": "PASS"`; it checks every claim-bearing file listed in
`REPRODUCIBILITY.md`, rather than duplicating a shorter hash list in CI.

On an L20 host:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap_remote.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/check_gpu.py
python -m pytest -q
```

The bootstrap script creates an isolated Python environment, installs a CUDA
PyTorch stack, and installs this package with training and development
dependencies. It does not download large model weights.

## Reproducing The Reported Checkpoints

Build the cross-benchmark scorecard:

```bash
python scripts/build_generalization_scorecard.py \
  --output-dir benchmarks/generalization_scorecard_2026_05_23
```

Expected output includes:

```json
{
  "status": "PASS",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "lcb_overall_improves",
      "value": 0.100474,
      "threshold": 0.0,
      "passed": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Re-run the packaged EvalPlus scoring:

```bash
python -m l20_codeforge eval-evalplus humaneval \
  benchmarks/evalplus_l20_codeforge_2026_05_22/samples/humaneval.mixed-target.literal-combined.public-consensus-selected.samples.jsonl \
  --output /tmp/humaneval_recheck.json \
  --parallel 8

python -m l20_codeforge eval-evalplus mbpp \
  benchmarks/evalplus_l20_codeforge_2026_05_22/samples/mbpp.temp08.n5-plus-basefallback-n30.public-consensus-shortest-selected.samples.jsonl \
  --output /tmp/mbpp_recheck.json \
  --parallel 8
```

LiveCodeBench full-suite reproduction requires a local materialized
`release_v6` JSONL with private tests. That file is intentionally not committed.
The committed package includes saved generations, compact summaries, hashes,
and evaluator outputs. See
`benchmarks/livecodebench_full_release_v6_2026_05_22/README.md` for the full
generation and replay commands.

## Key Artifacts

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `benchmarks/generalization_scorecard_2026_05_23/scorecard.json` | Machine-readable LCB + EvalPlus gate. |
| `benchmarks/livecodebench_full_release_v6_2026_05_22/full_n8_public_select_summary.json` | Headline full LCB `n=8` public-selection result. |
| `benchmarks/livecodebench_full_release_v6_2026_05_22/README.md` | Full LCB protocol, hashes, breakdowns, and commands. |
| `benchmarks/evalplus_l20_codeforge_2026_05_22/summary.csv` | EvalPlus greedy baselines and clean system rows. |
| `docs/MILESTONE_8_LCB_PLUS15_FOCUS.md` | Research plan for converting system gain into model-capability gain. |
| `docs/MILESTONE_9_XCODER_L20_PLUS15_PROBE.md` | X-Coder probe, control slices, positive results, and overfitting checks. |
| `scripts/evaluate_lcb_generations.py` | Hidden replay, public selection, behavior-input selection, and variable-candidate handling. |
| `scripts/regenerate_lcb_final_answers.py` | Second-pass code regeneration with optional public-test feedback. |
| `src/l20_codeforge/` | Package code for data, envs, evals, rewards, inference, training, and GPU profiling. |

## What Worked

- Full-suite `n=8` public-test selection moved Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from
  `297/1055` to `403/1055` on LiveCodeBench `release_v6`.
- EvalPlus clean public-signal systems improved HumanEval+ and MBPP+ without
  using EvalPlus extra tests for selection.
- One public-feedback repair round on the X-Coder medium control slice lifted
  the gate from `2/12` after public-only repair to `4/12`.
- The evaluation harness caught optimistic small-subset results and forced the
  project onto full-suite and cross-benchmark scorecards.

## What Failed

These failures are kept in the repository because they are useful research
signal, not noise.

- Small LiveCodeBench subsets were optimistic relative to the full 1,055-task
  suite.
- Automatic starter-prefix prompting did not generalize on the medium
  `control12` slice (`0/12`).
- Multi-source code-only repair did not improve the medium fail10 slice.
- A second public-feedback repair round produced public-test signal but `0/8`
  hidden passes, which is an overfitting warning.
- Input-only adaptive differential tests had little leverage when the candidate
  pool lacked multiple public-passing alternatives.
- The first expected-output verifier pass regressed the targeted replay, so it
  needs calibration or a stronger verifier before it can affect headline runs.

## Current Roadmap

1. Build mined verified algorithm-prefix data from public failures, while
   excluding exact LiveCodeBench prompts from training data.
2. Train or calibrate an expected-output verifier before allowing generated
   behavior tests to change headline selections.
3. Improve the X-Coder medium `control12` gate from `4/12` to `6/12+` with an
   automatic method, then scale to broader LCB slices.
4. Add a small QLoRA/SFT adapter only after the data path beats prompting and
   repair on held-out control slices.
5. Keep the generalization scorecard as the release gate for every benchmark
   claim.
